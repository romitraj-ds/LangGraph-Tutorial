Subject: Sick Leave - [Your Name]

Dear Marco Mancini,

I am writing to inform you that I will be unable to come to work today, [Date], due to illness. I woke up feeling unwell and believe it's best for me to rest and recover at home to avoid spreading any potential illness.

I will be unavailable for the entire week and will keep you updated on my condition. In the meantime, I will be checking emails periodically for urgent matters.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
